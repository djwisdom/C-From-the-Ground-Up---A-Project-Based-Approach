C Programming Mastery Course
This course is a structured journey designed to take you from a complete beginner to a proficient C programmer. Each step is a self-contained program that builds upon the concepts of the last, culminating in complex, practical projects.

The Beginner Path: Core Concepts
This section covers the absolute essentials of the C language. By the end, you'll be able to write simple, interactive command-line programs.

1_hello_world.c: Your journey begins. Learn the basic structure of a C program, how to use <stdio.h> for output, and the compile-run cycle.
2_variables_and_data_types.c: Discover how to store information. Concepts: int, double, float, char, and printing variables with format specifiers.
3_user_input.c: Make your programs interactive by learning how to read keyboard input from the user. Concepts: scanf(), the address-of operator &.
4_basic_operators.c: Perform calculations and make comparisons. Concepts: Arithmetic (+, /, %), Relational (==, >), and Logical (&&, ||) operators.
5_conditional_statements.c: Give your program a brain. Learn how to make decisions and control program flow. Concepts: if, else if, else.
6_loops.c: Teach your program to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. Concepts: for, while, do-while loops.
7_functions.c: Organize your code into clean, reusable blocks. Concepts: Function declaration (prototypes), definition, and calls.
8_arrays.c: Manage collections of related data. Concepts: Declaring, initializing, and iterating through arrays with loops.
9_strings.c: Master text manipulation in C. Concepts: Character arrays, the null terminator (\0), and essential functions from <string.h>.
The Intermediate Path: Deeper into C
Here, you will tackle the concepts that give C its power and reputation, focusing on memory management and creating your own data types.

10_pointers.c: Unlock C's most powerful feature. Understand memory addresses and learn to manipulate them. Concepts: The & (address-of) and * (dereference) operators.
11_pointers_and_arrays.c: Explore the deep, fundamental connection between pointers and arrays, and learn pointer arithmetic.
12_structs.c: Define your own custom data types by grouping different variables into a single unit. Essential for modeling real-world data.
13_dynamic_memory_allocation.c: Gain full control over your program's memory. Concepts: The "heap," malloc(), calloc(), and the critical importance of free().
14_file_io.c: Allow your programs to persist data by reading from and writing to files. Concepts: The FILE pointer, fopen(), fclose(), fprintf().
15_command_line_arguments.c: Make your programs more flexible by accepting input directly from the command line. Concepts: argc, argv.
The Advanced Path: Towards Mastery
This final section transitions from learning concepts to building sophisticated projects and understanding advanced, low-level features.

16_simple_calculator.c: Project 1. Combine your skills to create a complete, functional command-line calculator.
17_student_record_system.c: Project 2. Build a menu-driven database application using structs and file I/O to manage student records.
18_function_pointers.c: An advanced concept for writing highly flexible and dynamic code. Concepts: Callbacks, dispatch tables.
19_recursion.c: Learn an elegant alternative to loops by creating functions that call themselves. Concepts: Base cases, recursive steps.
20_linked_lists.c: Build a fundamental dynamic data structure from scratch, combining pointers, structs, and dynamic memory.
21_bit_manipulation.c: Go low-level by learning to operate on the individual bits of data. Concepts: Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, <<).
22_preprocessor_directives.c: Understand what happens before compilation. Concepts: #define for macros, #include for multi-file projects, and conditional compilation.
23_unions_and_enums.c: Learn specialized data types for efficient memory use (union) and for creating readable, named constants (enum).
24_static_and_extern_variables.c: Master variable scope and lifetime across multiple files. Concepts: Storage classes, internal vs. external linkage.
25_simple_text_editor.c: Final Capstone Project. Build a complete, line-based text editor using a doubly-linked list, integrating nearly every concept from this course.
