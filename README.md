An open-source curriculum for learning C programming by building a series of increasingly complex projects. This repository is designed to take you from writing `Hello, World!` to building a functional, line-based text editor from scratch.

> Learning to code is like building a house. You don't start with the roof. You start with a solid foundation. This course is designed to be that foundation, laid one brick‚Äîone concept, one project‚Äîat a time.

## ‚ú® Features

*   üéì **Step-by-Step Progression**: 25 carefully ordered lessons guide you from core syntax to advanced memory management.
*   ‚úîÔ∏è **Heavily Commented Code**: Every program is meticulously documented to explain not just *what* the code does, but *why* it does it that way.
*   üöÄ **Practical, Hands-On Projects**: Apply your knowledge immediately by building real tools like a command-line calculator and a text editor.
*   üß† **Focus on Fundamentals**: Deep dives into the concepts that make C powerful: pointers, memory allocation, data structures, and file I/O.
*   üìñ **Open Source & Community Driven**: Found a bug or have an idea for a better explanation? Contributions are welcome!

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started, you only need a C compiler. The code is written to be compliant with the C11 standard and is tested with GCC.

### Prerequisites

*   A C compiler like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/).
*   A text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, Vim, etc.).
*   A command-line terminal.

### How to Use This Repository

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dunamismax/C-From-the-Ground-Up---A-Project-Based-Approach.git
    cd C-From-the-Ground-Up---A-Project-Based-Approach
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a lesson:** Each program is a self-contained `.c` file.

3.  **Compile and Run:** Use your C compiler to compile the source code. The recommended flags enable extra warnings to help you write better code.

    ```sh
    # General compile command
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -o <output_name> <source_file.c>

    # Example for lesson 1
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -o hello_world 1_hello_world.c
    ```

4.  **Execute the program:**
    ```sh
    # On Linux/macOS
    ./hello_world

    # On Windows
    hello_world.exe
    ```

## üèÜ Capstone Project: Simple Text Editor

The final project (`25_simple_text_editor.c`) is a culmination of everything learned in this course. It's a fully functional, line-based text editor that can:
*   Append, insert, and delete lines of text.
*   Use a doubly-linked list to store the document in memory.
*   Load a document from a file when it starts.
*   Save the current text buffer back to the file.

![GIF of the text editor in action](https://i.imgur.com/example.gif)  <!-- Placeholder: Replace with an actual GIF of your editor! -->

**To run the editor:**
```sh
# Compile it
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -o editor 25_simple_text_editor.c

# Run it on a new or existing file
./editor my_document.txt
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
