 * =====================================================================================
 *
 * So far, our programs have either been non-persistent or have saved data in a
 * simple, unstructured way. Real-world applications, however, almost always
 * need to read structured dataâ€”user profiles, game levels, configuration
 * settings, etc. The process of reading this data and converting it into a
 * useful format (like a `struct`) is called PARSING.
 *
 * Today, we will learn how to parse a simple Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file.
 * Each line in the file will represent a single record, with fields separated
 * by commas.
 *
 * THE GOAL:
 * We will write a program that reads a file named `users.dat`. Each line of
 * this file will contain a user's ID, username, level, and active status.
 * Our program will parse each line and load the data into an array of `struct User`.
 *
 * We will explore two primary methods for parsing strings: `strtok` and `sscanf`.
 * As you will see, `sscanf` is often safer and more robust.

 * `sscanf` is often the best tool for this job. It's like `scanf`, but it reads

 * complex patterns, and its return value tells you how many items were
 * successfully assigned, which makes error checking very easy.

        // "%d"       - Reads an integer (the ID).
        // ","        - Matches and discards a literal comma.
        // "%49[^,]"  - This is the clever part for reading the username.
        //   `%[...]` is a scanset. It reads characters as long as they are in the set.
        //   `^` negates the set, so `[^,]` reads characters as long as they are NOT a comma.
        //   `49` is a width limit to prevent buffer overflow on `username[50]`.
        // ",%d,%d"   - Reads comma, integer, comma, integer for level and status.
        //
        // CRITICAL: We pass POINTERS to the variables where sscanf should store
        // the data. For integers, we use the address-of operator `&`. For the
        // character array `username`, the name itself decays to a pointer.

 *
 * `strtok` is another function for splitting a string. It works by finding a
 * delimiter, replacing it with a null terminator (`\0`), and returning a pointer
 * to the start of the token.
 *
 * WHY IS IT NOT PREFERRED?
 * 1. It MODIFIES the original string. This can be destructive and surprising.
 * 2. It is STATEFUL. You call it once with the string, then with NULL for
 *    subsequent tokens. This makes the code more complex and means you can't
 *    use it to parse two strings at once (it is not "re-entrant" or thread-safe).
 *
 * While `sscanf` is generally better, seeing a `strtok` implementation is useful
 * as you will encounter it in existing C code.
 *
 * Example `strtok` loop:
 *
 *   // Important: `strtok` modifies the string, so we'd need a copy.
 *   // char line_copy[MAX_LINE_LENGTH];
 *   // strcpy(line_copy, line);
 *
 *   char *token = strtok(line, ","); // Get first token
 *   if (token) user.id = atoi(token);
 *
 *   token = strtok(NULL, ","); // Get next token
 *   if (token) strcpy(user.username, token);
 *
 *   ... and so on. As you can see, it's more verbose and requires more care.

 *
 * HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN THIS CODE:
 *
 * This program requires a data file to read. You must create it first.
 *
 * 1. CREATE THE DATA FILE:
 *    In the same directory as this C file, create a new file named `users.dat`.
 *    Copy and paste the following content into it:
 *
 *    101,alpha_coder,15,1
 *    102,bit_wizard,22,1
 *    205,kernel_hacker,45,0
 *    this is a bad line and should be skipped
 *    310,logic_lord,33,1
 *    404,syntax_sorcerer,99,1
 *
 * 2. COMPILE THE C FILE:
 *    Open a terminal and navigate to the directory.
 *    `gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -o 34_parsing_data_files 34_parsing_data_files.c`
 *
 * 3. RUN THE EXECUTABLE:
 *    You must provide the name of the data file as a command-line argument.
 *    - On Linux/macOS:   `./34_parsing_data_files users.dat`
 *    - On Windows:       `34_parsing_data_files.exe users.dat`
 *
 *    The program will read `users.dat`, parse its contents, print a warning for
 *    the bad line, and then display the structured data it successfully extracted.
