<h1>C From The Ground Up - A Project-Based Journey</h1>
<p>
<b>A complete, open-source curriculum that teaches you C by building a portfolio of real-world tools and applications from scratch.</b>
</p>
<p>
This course uses a unique, hands-on teaching method: <b>the lesson is in the code</b>. You'll learn every concept from structured comments inside a single, runnable C file for each topic.

Welcome to the ultimate journey into the C programming language! This is not just a tutorial; it's a complete, foundational computer science education designed to build deep, practical knowledge. We start with the absolute basics‚Äîassuming you've never written a line of code‚Äîand end with a portfolio of impressive systems projects, including a multithreaded application and an advanced text-based RPG.

Learning C is learning the fundamentals of how computers truly work. This course is your foundation, laid one brick‚Äîone concept, one project‚Äîat a time. Mastering C will make you a fundamentally better developer, no matter what language you use in the future.
‚ú® Why This Journey?
üìñ Learn Directly In The Code: Forget switching between theory and practice. Every lesson is taught directly within the comments of a single, runnable C file. The code is the textbook.
üë®‚Äçüíª True Beginners Welcome: This course has zero prerequisites. We'll guide you through installing a compiler and writing printf("Hello, World!"); before we even think about pointers.
üöÄ From Console to Systems Mastery: The curriculum is carefully designed to build your skills layer by layer. You'll master C fundamentals, build a portfolio of classic command-line tools, and finally develop complex, multi-file applications.
üõ†Ô∏è Build an Impressive Portfolio: The entire course is oriented around practical projects. Every concept, from malloc to pthreads, is a building block for tools like your own grep, a tiny shell, and a final text adventure game.
üí™ Master the Hard Parts: We embrace C's most powerful (and feared) features. You will gain true confidence with pointers, dynamic memory allocation, low-level bit manipulation, process management, and multithreading.
üåç Open Source & Community Driven: This curriculum is for the community. Contributions, suggestions, bug fixes, and project ideas are highly encouraged!
üíª Tech Stack & Prerequisites
You don't need any programming knowledge to start, but you will need to install a few standard development tools.

A C Compiler like GCC (recommended) or Clang.
Make for automating the build process in later projects.
Git for cloning the repository.
An IDE or Text Editor (Visual Studio Code, CLion, Vim, or Sublime Text are great choices).
üöÄ How to Use This Course
Each lesson folder contains one or more source files. For most of the course, a single .c file is both the complete, runnable program and the full lesson text.

Read the Lesson: Navigate to a lesson folder (e.g., Part1_Core_Concepts/01_HelloWorld/) and open the .c file. Read the comments from top to bottom to understand the concepts.
Compile and Run the Code: To see the lesson's concepts in action, you'll need to compile and run the program.
First, clone the repository (you only need to do this once):
git clone https://github.com/dunamismax/C-From-the-Ground-Up---A-Project-Based-Journey.git
cd C-From-the-Ground-Up---A-Project-Based-Journey
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Sh
Then, for each lesson, navigate to its folder and use the C compiler. We highly recommend using these flags to catch common errors.
# Example for the first lesson
cd Part1_Core_Concepts/01_HelloWorld

# Compile the code using GCC
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.c

# Run the compiled program
# On Linux/macOS
./HelloWorld

# On Windows
HelloWorld.exe
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Sh
Note: Later projects will use Make. In those cases, you will simply run the make command in the lesson directory.
üìö The Journey
The curriculum is divided into five parts, taking you from a blank text file to a C master capable of building complex systems applications.
