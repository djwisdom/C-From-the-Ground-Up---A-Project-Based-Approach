 * @brief Teaches how to organize code into reusable blocks called functions.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * What's New in This Program?
 *
 * As programs grow, putting all your code inside the `main` function becomes messy
 * and hard to manage. "Functions" are the solution. A function is a named,
 * self-contained block of code that performs a specific task.
 *
 * Think of `main` as the manager of a project. The manager shouldn't do all the
 * work themselves. Instead, they delegate tasks to specialists. Functions are those
 * specialists.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 *
 * 1.  **Function Prototype (or Declaration):** This is a forward-declaration at the
 *     top of the file. It tells the compiler what a function is called, what kind of
 *     data it returns, and what arguments it expects. It's like a table of contents
 *     that lets `main` know which functions are available to be called.
 *
 * 2.  **Function Definition:** This is the actual implementation of the functionâ€”the
 *     code that performs the task. This is where the specialist's instructions live.
 *
 * 3.  **Function Call:** This is the act of "invoking" or "running" a function from
 *     `main` or from another function. This is the manager delegating the task.
 *
 * Why use functions?
 * - **Organization:** Keeps `main` clean and easy to read.
 * - **Reusability:** Write a task once and call it many times. No more copy-pasting!
 * - **Abstraction:** You can use a function without needing to know the complex details of *how* it works.
 * - **Easier Debugging:** When something goes wrong, you can often isolate the problem to a specific function.
 *

 *
 * How to Compile and Run This Program:
 *
 * `gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -o functions 7_functions.c`
 * `./functions` (or `functions.exe` on Windows)
 *
